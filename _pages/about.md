I'm currently an MBA Candidate and the Class of 2025 at Harvard Business School. Prior to this, I pursued a dual B.S./M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My specialization focused on robotics and computer vision. During my time at CMU, I did research in the [Navlab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/navlab/) and worked on soccer robots for the RoboCup under [Prof. Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/).

I'm currently working on my own startup, but during whatever free time I have left, I am a Managing Partner at Twenty25 Ventures (HBS Class of 2025 Investment Fund), Tiktok/Instagram tech creator, and pageant coach. I also love playing volleyball, tennis, and poker.
